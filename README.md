## Preparing the directory
- Create a new directory 
- Copy the Code & Input folder to the given directory
- Then copy the files 'final_methy_data.csv' and 'final_mRNA_normalized.csv' from the Input folder to the Code folder
- Run the command in the R source("..../main.R")
- A folder named "Results" will be created, and all intermediate results of the code will be saved here
- The final ranked genes will be saved in the Code folder
    1. filtered_ranks.csv
    2. methy_gene_rank.csv
    3. mRNA_gene_rank.csv
